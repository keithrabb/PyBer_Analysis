# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The president of PyBer, a company valued at $2.3 Bil, asked for a ride-sharing data with respect to rural, suburban & urban city types.  Using Pandas and Matplotlib, a graph was created that shows the total weekly fares for each city type for a period of four months.

## Results:

- The results show a disparity between Rural and Urban rides for the four month period.  People that are used to traveling distance have a vehice or have usually given thought to travel in those areas.

- Urban and Suburban areas are more populated so the rate of travel is going to be higher in that area.

## Summary:

Based on the analysis there are three recomendations to the president of PyBer (four based on what I consider to be important):

1 - The sample size is too short a time period.  Reconsider doing the study again after having a full year of analysis.  The next recommendation will explain why.

2 - Advertise, Advertise, Advertise.  Having a full year of sample size will tell the CEO when the best times to advertise will be.  Is there a tourist season?  It may not be relected in the sample.  Granted that Rural revenue will never catch up to Suburban or Urban, but by advertising in the right areas and right times would keep in the forefront of the mind.  It never hurts to remind people to "drink responsibly" by using the ride sharing app. 

3 - There could be specials during certain periods to encourage use of the company.  This can easily be pin-pointed based on trending the fares to boost fares in those periods that are trending low.

4 - No one ever wants to lower their price, but to increase volume, it may have to happen.  More analysis should be done for the areas where they may be competing against other ride sharing companies.  If this is the case, customers may be finding a better deal.  It is worth having the business intelligence to know if an area is worth concentrating in or not.
